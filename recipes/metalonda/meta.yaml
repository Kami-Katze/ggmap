  summary: 'METAgenomic LONgitudinal Differential Abundance method'
  description: |
    MetaLonDA (METAgenomic LONgitudinal Differential Abundance method) is a
    method that identifies the significant time intervals of microbial features
    in longitudinal studies. MetaLonDA has the ability to handle the
    inconsistencies and common challenges associated with human studies, such
    as variable sample collection times and uneven number of time points along
    the subjectsâ€™ longitudinal study. The method employs a negative binomial
    distribution in conjunction with a semi-parametric SS-ANOVA to model the
    read counts. Then, it performs the significance testing based on unit
    time intervals using permutation testing procedure.
