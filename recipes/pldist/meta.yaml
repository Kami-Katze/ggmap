  summary: 'Paired and Longitudinal Ecological Dissimilarities'
  description: |
    pldist allows distance-based analysis of paired and longitudinal microbiome
    data. In particular, the package supports both paired and longitudinal
    versions of unweighted UniFrac, generalized UniFrac, Bray-Curtis, Jaccard,
    Gower, and Kulczynski distances or dissimilarities. Functions implementing
    the transformations that underlie these distances are also provided so that
    transformed OTU data may be included in analyses beyond distance-based
    methods. The code can handle paired data, balanced longitudinal data, and
    unbalanced longitudinal data, although use for highly unbalanced designs
    is not recommended.
